# Code 

## `Clean_Table_Format.ipynb`

As the name suggested, `Clean_Table_Format.ipynb` is the code we used to 
clean the table we got from stage 2 to better suit our purpose of this 
project stage.

## `Entity_machting.ipynb`

`Entity_machting.ipynb` is the main IPython Notebook for stage 3.

## `down_sample.py`

`down_sample.py` is the modified version of `down_sample.py` we used for our 
project. Details are described in our [report](https://github.com/iphyer/CS839ClassProject/blob/master/stage3/Stage3Report.pdf).
